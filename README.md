# Image-translate

Translates text on image using Python and OCR.

## How it works

This simple script takes all the images in a folder and takes text in it (using OCR). Then it translates the text to destination language (by default from english to czech). Finally it prints out the translated text on command line (terminal).

## Why?

I found this useful when trying to translate text of a pdf book. In front of downloading the file, extracting it, opening it, then copyiing the text and giving it to a translator. You can use this script and simply translate it in seconds (depending on your pc performace. My laptop can do 5 in second). There are many other usefull situations where to use it. Can you find your own? Make issue about it!

## Nice, but how do I use it?

Simply clone, move to the cloned repo. Then make screenshot of text you want to translate (on windows > windows + PrtSc or just Sc (depending on your system options)). Save that image to test_images subfolder and you are all done! Good thing is that you can save multiple images and translate them at once! Now simply run the file.

## Needs

You must have tesseract OCR package installed. Use this [https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Downloads](link) to download. Use installer please.
